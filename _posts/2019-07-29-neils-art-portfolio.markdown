# Another beautiful Portfolio piece to share

Our fellow student and frontend art hero Neil has been working on a nice showcase piece of his frontend skills. His page is loaded with examples and should give lots of inspiration to students who might be looking for ideas on what else to work on during the lab.

Please check out his web site [here](http://www.artofneil.com/).
