# A new beginning with JavaScript

This is it! We have reached the mid point of the program and I would like to thank everyone for working hard and showing up regularly. I also really appreciate to see people's work and would like to continue sharing pages, portfolios and examples.

As much as it was fun working with and exploring HTML5 and CSS3, it is now time to learn some JavaScript. Some of the best tools for exploring JS are your browser and any console capable of executing JavaScript.

There are several add ons for Visual Studio Code that will allow you to test, execute and debug .js files, but unless you have already installed these features or are already accustomed to them I recommend just using the [browser](https://youprogrammer.com/how-to-run-javascript-file-program-in-browser/) for now.

Some of our first examples are going to look a lot like this:

``` javascript
function square(x) {
    return (x * x)
}

console.log(square(3))
```

If anyone does feel the need at this point to explore the console more, there is a way to unlock UNIX and LINUX console commands in Windows 10 with the Bash Shell. [This](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/) is a guide that explains how to get a Linux command shell in Windows 10. I personally recommend the Ubuntu version for everyone not experienced with Linux yet, and of course any flavor for people who have experience and understand the difference.
