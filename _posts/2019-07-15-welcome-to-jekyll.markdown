This is a basic course accompanying blog written in [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).

Jekyll allows users to easily host a free blog on GitHub pages.

Jekyll offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight html %}
<html>
  <head>
    <some stuff>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Title</h1>
  </body>
</head>
{% endhighlight %}
