# Gotchas and difficult questions:

Questions 9 and 10 seemed tricky to many students. [This](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-flow) is a very good resource to read more about FlexBox.

Check out [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/columns#Syntax) link to help with question 10.

Some students have answered question 12 with ```{overflow: contain;}```, which is NOT a valid CSS overflow property.

In general most students were able to answer questions 1 through 12 well, with some exceptions, as mentioned. Most difficulties were found on the last page (questions 13 - 20).

Question 13 is about the CSS box-shadow. A good link to help with this question can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow#Values).

Question 14 is about the CSS transform attribute and a good resource can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/transform#Translate).

Extra credit...why is answer c not valid for question 14???

Question 18 was about the [setTimeout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout) method.

Question 19 in regards of [touch events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TouchEvent#Touch_event_types) is something that will be on the exam.

Question 20 the DOM File API and what it is, can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Extensions/Using_the_DOM_File_API_in_chrome_code).
