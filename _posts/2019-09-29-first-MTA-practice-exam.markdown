### The first Practice exam

After taking the first MTA practice exam we collected some feedback and it seems that the  two sections that gave students the most problems were section 1 and the JavaScript portion.

This blogpost is mainly discussing difficult questions from section 1.

Some of these issues were:

* Windows Phone related issues
  * touch gestures in context with the Windows Phone
  * touch screen size
* other yet unknown touch gestures
* Windows Play Store related issues
  * details on how to package apps for the playstore
  * details on the process of publishing to the playstore
* What is ['Tombstoning'?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-tombstoning-in-the-context-of-mobile-application-development)
* Advanced Features such as [Geolocation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/Windows.Devices.Geolocation), messaging and such

# Some positive news about the MTA 98-375

I found [this](http://www.pearsonitcertification.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1960226) post from 2012.

It seems that there will be between 30 and 50 questions in a time period of 50 minutes. The passing score of 70 which is apparently not a percentage, so I guess some kind of weighted point system.

It also seems that there are unlimited attempts on taking this exam and all you have to do to take it is log into your certiport account. The only limitation that seems to exist is that after the second unsuccessful attempt, there is a mandatory 14 day/2 week waiting period before you can try a third time, and further consecutive times if need be also have to be taken after a 14 day waiting period.
