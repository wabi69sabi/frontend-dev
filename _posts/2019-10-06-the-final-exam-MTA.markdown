### The MTA exam

On Friday October 4th we took the MTA 98-375 exam at the amazon OAK4 career choice classroom and it is with great pride that I can now say it was a huge success. All students that attempted the exam passed and were therefore able to move one step further in starting their career in the exciting field of application development. I appreciate the hard work ethics that seemed to come natural to my students who all worked at amazon while taking this course. Their success speaks for itself.

# Thanks

In addition I would like to thank all participating students and wish them the best of luck for their path ahead. I will continue to support this blog and also be available over email. There is one more post after this that I am dedicating purely on how to harden your current skillset, apply for suitable positions and add new relevant technology to your resume.

 At this point I would like to give a special thanks to the students who have shared some of their projects with us on this blog, and would like to link to each piece again individually:
