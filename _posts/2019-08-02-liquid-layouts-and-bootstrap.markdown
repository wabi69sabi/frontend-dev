# Liquid Layout

Please find the examples from the book regarding Chapter 12 [here](https://github.com/wabi69sabi/fronted-course/tree/master/Chapter12)

# Bootstrap

Bootstrap, which is in essence a large CSS and JS library that can be found [here](https://getbootstrap.com/), can be used to build responsive web pages. One of the major strengths of Bootstrap is the liquid design model known as the [Bootstrap grid system](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/).

Bootstrap can be used either by adding the online library into your header link list or by downloading the entire library and linking to it locally. The advantage to linking it locally is that every file is there to look at and edit. The disadvantage is the time and space it takes.
